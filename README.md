# NoSql-Social-Network-API

## Approach

This NoSql API utilizies Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM. First, models were created for both **Users** and **Thoughts**. These were the basis for creating the schemas for the users, thoughts, and reactions. The controllers file handles all the javascript routes to populate each endpoint. Using Insomnia, the user can successfully:

-GET all users

-GET user by Id

-Update a user

-Delete a user

-Get all thoughts

-Get a thought by Id

-Update a Thought

-Delete a Thought

In addition to adding and deleting **Friends** and **Reactions**. While Reactions may seem confusing at first, they are simply comments on thoughts.
